## What is AI?  
- **Economic Impact**: McKinsey predicts AI will add $13–22 trillion annually by 2033, with $4 trillion from generative AI.  
- **Two Key Concepts**:  
  1. **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**:  
     - AI that does one task well (e.g., smart speakers, self-driving cars, web search).  
     - “One-trick ponies” with high value in specific applications.  
  2. **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**:  
     - Goal of AI that matches or exceeds human intellect across tasks.  
     - Far off (decades or centuries away); requires major breakthroughs.  
- **Generative AI**: Newer tech (e.g., ChatGPT) producing text, images, audio; expands AI’s versatility.

## Machine Learning Basics  
- **Definition**: A field where computers learn without explicit programming (Arthur Samuel).  
- **Core Type**: **Supervised Learning**  
  - Learns A → B (input → output) mappings.  
  - Examples:  
    - Email → Spam/Not Spam (spam filter).  
    - Audio → Text (speech recognition).  
    - Image → Car Positions (self-driving cars).  
    - Ad Info → Click Prediction (online ads).  
- **Why It’s Booming**:  
  - **More Data**: Digitization (Internet, computers) provides vast datasets.  
  - **Neural Networks/Deep Learning**: Performance improves with more data and larger models (unlike traditional AI).  
  - **Fast Computers**: GPUs enable training large models.

---

## Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- **How They Work**:  
  - Trained on massive text (billions/trillions of words) to predict the next word.  
  - Example: “My favorite drink is” → “lychee”.  
  - Builds sentences by repeating this process from a prompt.  
- **Roots**: Supervised learning powers LLMs like ChatGPT.

## What is Data?  
- **Definition**: Information (e.g., spreadsheets, images) used to train AI.  
- **Examples**:  
  - Housing: Size (# bedrooms, sq ft) → Price.  
  - Cat Detection: Images → Cat/Not Cat.  
- **Sources**:  
  1. **Manual Labeling**: Humans tag data (e.g., cat pics).  
  2. **Observation**: User behavior (e.g., e-commerce purchases) or machine data (e.g., factory temps).  
  3. **Downloads/Partners**: Web datasets or shared data (e.g., medical images).  
- **Pitfalls**:  
  - **Overhype**: More data isn’t always valuable without purpose.  
  - **Messiness**: Incorrect/missing data (“garbage in, garbage out”).  
  - **Misuse**: Don’t hoard data for years; use AI early to guide IT.

## AI Terminology  
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Software that learns A → B mappings (e.g., ad click prediction).  
- **Data Science**: Extracts insights from data (e.g., “renovated homes sell 15% higher”).  
- **Deep Learning/Neural Networks**:  
  - ML subset using artificial neurons to learn complex A → B mappings.  
  - Inspired loosely by the brain but mathematically distinct.  
- **AI Diagram**:  
  - AI > Machine Learning > Deep Learning (plus other tools like generative AI).

## What Makes a Company Good at AI?  
- **Not Just Tools**: Using neural networks doesn’t make you an AI company.  
- **AI-First Traits**:  
  - Strategic data acquisition (e.g., free products for data).  
  - Unified data warehouses (not siloed).  
  - Spotting automation opportunities (A → B tasks).  
  - New roles (e.g., Machine Learning Engineers).  
- **AI Transformation Playbook**:  
  1. Pilot projects for momentum.  
  2. Build an in-house AI team + training.  
  3. Develop an AI strategy.  
  4. Align internal/external messaging.  
  5. Scale up systematically.

## What AI Can and Cannot Do  
- **Rule of Thumb**: If a human can do it in <1 second, AI can likely automate it.  
- **Can Do**:  
  - Simple tasks with lots of data:  
    - Detect cars (self-driving).  
    - Diagnose pneumonia (X-rays).  
    - Spot scratches (manufacturing).  
- **Cannot Do**:  
  - Complex tasks or low data:  
    - Predict stock prices (too random).  
    - Read human gestures (too varied, safety-critical).  
    - Learn from textbooks (unlike humans).  
- **Weaknesses**:  
  - Struggles with new data types (e.g., X-rays from a different hospital).  
  - Requires technical diligence to confirm feasibility.

## Neural Networks Explained  
- **Basics**:  
  - Artificial neurons (like Lego bricks) compute simple functions.  
  - Stacked together, they map A → B accurately.  
- **Example**: T-shirt demand prediction:  
  - Inputs (A): Price, shipping, marketing, material.  
  - Outputs (B): Demand.  
  - Neurons auto-learn factors (e.g., affordability, awareness).  
- **Face Recognition**:  
  - Inputs: Pixel values (millions for a photo).  
  - Outputs: Person’s identity.  
  - Early neurons detect edges, later ones identify faces.

## Key Takeaways  
- AI is transformative but not magic—focus on feasible, valuable projects.  
- Supervised learning and data drive today’s AI success.  
- Start small, iterate fast, and align IT/AI efforts early.  
- Understand limits to avoid overhype (e.g., AGI is distant).
